My dad wanted me to practice coding by coding something for him to use for work. Being the 17 year old i am i wanted to play games. I ended up finishing the code anyways.

All of the code is labeled with what it does already but heres a TLDR.

You input a file, specifically one from my dad's work, and my program extracts information from it. Make it all nice, and puts it into a readable formate. More readable format. That is all
